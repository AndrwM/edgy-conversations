<section class="book">

  <h1><span>You've Been Told To... </span>Set goals. Work hard. Be persistent.</h1>

  <div class="left-content">
    <h2>It’s the typical success advice you can probably repeat in your sleep.</h2>
    <p>The type of advice that doesn’t seem to work for you – or anyone you know, for that matter. That’s what you are already doing. You work your butt off, but at the end of the day, you’re no closer to success than you were yesterday.</p>
    <p><strong>EDGY Conversations</strong> is a gut-wrenchingly honest, no-holds-barred discussion about confronting and fixing the beliefs and behaviors that limit your ability to be amazing. It tackles head-on the uncomfortable yet powerful truth that pain, fear and love – yes, love – have a huge impact on success.</p>
    <p><strong>You’ll read more than 100 stories of ordinary people who become extraordinary.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <img src="images/book-stack.png" class="book-stack">

  <div class="diver">You’ll be inspired by a master chef, a World War II veteran, a teenage prairie girl, a homeless retired paramedic, an Australian potato farmer and a shoe executive who became amazing, did the unthinkable, and forever changed their corner of the world.</div>
