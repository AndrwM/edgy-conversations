<section class="book">
  <div class="wrapper">

    <h1><span>You've Been Told To... </span>Set goals. Work hard. Be persistent.</h1>
    <h2>It&#8217;s the typical success advice you can probably repeat in your sleep.</h2>
    
    <div class="left-content">
      <p>The type of advice that doesn&#8217;t seem to work for you &#8211; or anyone you know, for that matter. That&#8217;s what you are already doing. You work your butt off, but at the end of the day, you&#8217;re no closer to success than you were yesterday.</p>
      <p><strong>EDGY Conversations</strong> is a gut-wrenchingly honest, no-holds-barred discussion about confronting and fixing the beliefs and behaviors that limit your ability to be amazing. It tackles head-on the uncomfortable yet powerful truth that pain, fear and love &#8211; yes, love &#8211; have a huge impact on success.</p>
      <p><strong>You&#8217;ll read more than 100 stories of ordinary people who become extraordinary.</strong></p>

    <div class="diver">You&#8217;ll be inspired by a master chef, a World War II veteran, a teenage prairie girl, a homeless retired paramedic, an Australian potato farmer and a shoe executive who became amazing, did the unthinkable, and forever changed their corner of the world.</div>
